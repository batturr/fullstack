# 1. HTML Basics & Structure

---

### **Q1. What does HTML stand for and what is its purpose?**

**Answer:**
HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard language used to **structure and organize content** on a web page — text, images, videos, forms, and links. HTML acts as the **skeleton** of any website.

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p>This is built using HTML.</p>
```

> **Real-time:** Every website, from Google to Amazon, starts with an HTML structure before any styling or interactivity is added.

---

### **Q2. Describe the basic structure of an HTML document.**

**Answer:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is the visible content.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Key Parts:**

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `<!DOCTYPE html>` | Declares the document as HTML5 |
| `<html>` | Root element wrapping all content |
| `<head>` | Contains metadata (title, charset, CSS links) |
| `<body>` | Contains all visible page content |

---

### **Q3. What does `<!DOCTYPE html>` do?**

**Answer:**
`<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser to render the page using **HTML5 standards mode**. Without it, the browser may use **quirks mode**, which renders pages inconsistently.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Test</title></head>
  <body><p>Hello</p></body>
</html>
```

> It is **not** an HTML tag — it is a **declaration** to the browser.

---

### **Q4. What is the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag?**

**Answer:**
The `lang` attribute specifies the **language** of the document content. It helps screen readers pronounce content correctly and assists search engines with localization.

```html
<html lang="en">    <!-- English -->
<html lang="hi">    <!-- Hindi -->
<html lang="te">    <!-- Telugu -->
```

> **Real-time:** Google uses the `lang` attribute to serve regional search results.

---

### **Q5. What is the difference between the `<head>` and `<body>` tags?**

**Answer:**

| `<head>` | `<body>` |
|----------|----------|
| Contains metadata | Contains visible content |
| Title, CSS, meta tags, scripts | Text, images, forms, tables |
| Not displayed to the user | Displayed on the browser |

```html
<head>
  <title>Login Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Login</h1>
  <form>...</form>
</body>
```

---

### **Q6. What is an HTML tag?**

**Answer:**
A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets `< >` that defines how the browser should display or structure content. Tags usually come in **pairs** — an opening tag and a closing tag.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!--  ↑ Opening tag       ↑ Closing tag -->
```

**Self-closing tags** (void elements) don't have a closing partner:
```html
<br>  <hr>  <img>  <input>
```

---

### **Q7. What is the difference between an HTML element and an HTML tag?**

**Answer:**

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Tag** | The markup keyword in angle brackets | `<p>`, `</p>` |
| **Element** | The full structure: opening tag + content + closing tag | `<p>Hello</p>` |

```html
<!-- Tag: <h1> and </h1> -->
<!-- Element: <h1>Welcome</h1> -->
<h1>Welcome</h1>
```

---

### **Q8. What are HTML attributes?**

**Answer:**
Attributes provide **additional information** about HTML elements. They are always specified in the **opening tag** as `name="value"` pairs.

```html
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Profile Photo" width="200">
<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
<input type="email" placeholder="Enter email" required>
```

**Common attributes:** `id`, `class`, `style`, `src`, `href`, `alt`, `title`, `name`, `value`, `placeholder`.

---

### **Q9. What is the difference between `id` and `class` attributes?**

**Answer:**

| Feature | `id` | `class` |
|---------|------|---------|
| Uniqueness | Must be **unique** on a page | Can be used on **multiple** elements |
| Selector | `#myId` | `.myClass` |
| JavaScript | `getElementById()` | `getElementsByClassName()` |
| Use case | Target one specific element | Style multiple elements |

```html
<div id="header">Only one header</div>
<div class="card">Card 1</div>
<div class="card">Card 2</div>
```

---

### **Q10. What are `data-*` attributes and when should they be used?**

**Answer:**
`data-*` attributes store **custom data** inside HTML elements. They are accessible via JavaScript using `dataset`.

```html
<button data-id="104" data-name="Mahesh" data-role="admin">
  View Profile
</button>

<script>
  const btn = document.querySelector("button");
  console.log(btn.dataset.id);    // "104"
  console.log(btn.dataset.name);  // "Mahesh"
  console.log(btn.dataset.role);  // "admin"
</script>
```

> **Real-time:** E-commerce product cards store `data-product-id` for dynamic JS actions.

---

### **Q11. How do you add comments in HTML and why?**

**Answer:**
HTML comments are wrapped in `<!-- ... -->`. They are invisible to users but visible in source code.

```html
<!-- Navigation Section -->
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <!-- <a href="/about">About</a>  (temporarily disabled) -->
</nav>
```

**Use cases:**
- Code documentation
- Temporarily disabling HTML
- Debugging & collaboration

---

### **Q12. What are void (empty/self-closing) elements? Give examples.**

**Answer:**
Void elements are tags that **cannot have child content** and do not have a closing tag.

```html
<br>      <!-- Line break -->
<hr>      <!-- Horizontal rule -->
<img>     <!-- Image -->
<input>   <!-- Input field -->
<meta>    <!-- Metadata -->
<link>    <!-- External resource link -->
<source>  <!-- Media source -->
<area>    <!-- Image map area -->
<col>     <!-- Table column -->
<wbr>     <!-- Word break opportunity -->
```

---

  <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>World</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**DOM Tree:**
```
Document
  └── html
       └── body
            ├── h1 → "Hello"
            └── p  → "World"
```

| Used by | Plain HTML/JS | React, Vue |
| Performance | Slower for frequent updates | Faster for dynamic UIs |

---

### **Q185. What is event bubbling and event capturing?**

**Answer:**

| Concept | Direction | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Bubbling** | Child → Parent ↑ | Events propagate upward |
| **Capturing** | Parent → Child ↓ | Events propagate downward |

```html
<div id="parent" onclick="console.log('Parent clicked')">
  <button id="child" onclick="console.log('Button clicked')">Click</button>
</div>

<!-- Clicking button outputs:
  "Button clicked" (target)
  "Parent clicked" (bubbles up)
-->
```

```javascript
// Stop bubbling
button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
});

// Use capturing phase
parent.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Captured!");
}, true);  // true = capturing phase
```

**WCAG Levels:**

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **A** | Basic accessibility (minimum) |
| **AA** | Recommended (most laws target this) |
| **AAA** | Highest level (not always achievable) |

**4 Principles (POUR):**
1. **Perceivable** — Content must be presentable to all senses
2. **Operable** — Interface must be navigable by all users
3. **Understandable** — Content must be readable and predictable
4. **Robust** — Content must work with various assistive technologies

---

### **Q188. What are ARIA roles?**

**Answer:**
**ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** roles define the **purpose** of an element for assistive technologies.

```html
<div role="alert">Form submitted successfully!</div>
<div role="dialog" aria-label="Confirm deletion">...</div>
<div role="navigation">...</div>
<div role="tablist">...</div>
<div role="button" tabindex="0">Custom Button</div>
```

> **Rule:** Prefer semantic HTML over ARIA. Use `<button>` instead of `<div role="button">`.

---

### **Q189. What is `aria-label`?**

**Answer:**
Provides an **accessible name** for elements that have no visible text label.

```html
<button aria-label="Close popup">✕</button>

<div aria-hidden="true">
  <img src="decoration.png" alt="">
</div>
```

---

### **Q192. What is `aria-live`?**

**Answer:**
Announces **dynamic content changes** to screen readers.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `off` | Don't announce |

  menu.hidden = expanded;
}
</script>
```

---

### **Q194. What is `tabindex`?**

**Answer:**
Controls the **keyboard focus order** of elements.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|

| `-1` | Focusable only via JavaScript |
| `1+` | Custom order (❌ avoid — disrupts natural flow) |

```html
<div tabindex="0">Focusable div (in natural order)</div>
<div tabindex="-1" id="modal">Only focusable via JS</div>

<script>
document.getElementById("modal").focus();  // Programmatic focus
</script>
```

---

### **Q195. How do you make images accessible?**

**Answer:**

```html
<!-- Informative image — descriptive alt -->
<img src="villa.jpg" alt="3BHK luxury villa with garden and pool in Jubilee Hills">

<!-- Decorative image — empty alt -->
<img src="border-design.png" alt="">

<!-- Complex image — long description -->
<figure>
  <img src="chart.png" alt="Sales chart showing 40% growth in Q4 2025">

</nav>
```

**Values:** `page`, `step`, `location`, `date`, `time`, `true`.

---

### **Q199. Why prefer semantic HTML over ARIA?**

**Answer:**

```html
<!-- ❌ ARIA version — more code, same meaning -->
<div role="button" tabindex="0" aria-pressed="false">Click Me</div>
<div role="navigation"><a href="/">Home</a></div>

<!-- ✅ Semantic version — built-in accessibility -->
<button>Click Me</button>
<nav><a href="/">Home</a></nav>
```

**First Rule of ARIA:** Don't use ARIA if native HTML already provides the semantics.

---

  <button>Discard</button>
</div>
```

---

### **Q204. What is skip navigation?**

**Answer:**
A hidden link that allows keyboard users to **skip to main content**, bypassing navigation.

```html
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>

<nav>... long navigation ...</nav>

<main id="main-content">
  <h1>Page Content</h1>
</main>

<style>
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;

**Answer:**

| Heading | SEO Role |
|---------|----------|
| `<h1>` | Main page topic (one per page) |
| `<h2>` | Major sections |
| `<h3>` | Sub-sections |
| `<h4>-<h6>` | Further breakdown |

**Best practices:**
- ✅ One `<h1>` per page
- ✅ Follow hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- ✅ Include keywords naturally
- ❌ Don't skip levels (H1 → H3)
- ❌ Don't use headings just for font size

---

### **Q217. How do you optimize HTML for SEO?**

**Answer:**

1. ✅ Use **semantic HTML** (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`)
2. ✅ One **`<h1>`** with target keyword
3. ✅ Descriptive **`<title>`** (50-60 chars)
4. ✅ Compelling **meta description** (150-160 chars)
5. ✅ **`alt` text** on all images
6. ✅ Clean URLs (e.g., `/3bhk-flat-madhapur`)
7. ✅ Fast page load (lazy loading, compression)
8. ✅ Mobile-responsive design
9. ✅ Internal linking
10. ✅ Structured data (JSON-LD)

---

### **Q218. What is the `<meta http-equiv>` tag?**

**Answer:**
Simulates HTTP response headers via meta tags.

```html
<!-- Auto-refresh page every 30 seconds -->
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

<!-- Redirect after 5 seconds -->

<!-- Content Security Policy -->
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'">

<!-- Compatibility mode for IE -->
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
```

---

### **Q219. What is the difference between `name` and `property` in meta tags?**

**Answer:**

| Attribute | Standard | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `name` | HTML meta | `<meta name="description" content="...">` |
| `property` | Open Graph (Facebook) | `<meta property="og:title" content="...">` |

```html
<!-- Standard HTML meta -->
<meta name="description" content="Buy flats in Hyderabad">
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">

<!-- Open Graph meta -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Best Properties">

```

---

### **Q220. What is the `content` attribute in meta tags?**

**Answer:**
The `content` attribute holds the **value** of the meta tag.

```html
<meta name="description" content="This is the page description">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<meta property="og:title" content="Page Title for Social Media">
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
```

> `content` is **required** when using `name`, `property`, or `http-equiv`.

# 12. Responsive Web Design

---

### **Q221. What is responsive web design?**

**Answer:**
Responsive web design makes web pages render well on **all devices** (mobile, tablet, desktop) using fluid layouts, flexible images, and media queries.

**Key techniques:**
- CSS Flexbox & Grid
- Media queries
- Responsive images (`srcset`, `<picture>`)
- Viewport meta tag
- Relative units (`%`, `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`)

---

### **Q222. What is the viewport and how do you set it?**

**Answer:**
The viewport is the **visible area** of a web page on a device.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

**Without it:** Mobile browsers render pages at ~980px width and zoom out.
**With it:** Pages match the device width.

---

### **Q223. What are media queries?**

**Answer:**
CSS rules that apply **only when conditions** (screen size, orientation, etc.) are met.

```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
.card { width: 100%; }

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .card { width: 50%; }    /* Tablet: 2 columns */
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .card { width: 33.33%; }  /* Desktop: 3 columns */
}

/* Orientation */
@media (orientation: landscape) {
  .sidebar { display: block; }
}
```

---

### **Q224. What is mobile-first design?**

**Answer:**
Design for **mobile layout first**, then progressively enhance for larger screens.

```css
/* Base styles (mobile) */
.container { padding: 10px; }
.nav { display: none; }
.hamburger { display: block; }

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .nav { display: flex; }
  .hamburger { display: none; }
}
```

> **Advantage:** Mobile users (majority) get optimized experience.

---

### **Q225. What are common responsive breakpoints?**

**Answer:**

| Breakpoint | Device |
|-----------|--------|
| 320px – 480px | Mobile phones |
| 481px – 768px | Tablets |
| 769px – 1024px | Small laptops |
| 1025px – 1200px | Desktops |
| 1201px+ | Large screens |

```css
@media (max-width: 480px) { /* Mobile */ }
@media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px) { /* Tablet */ }
@media (min-width: 769px) { /* Desktop */ }
```

---

### **Q226. What is a fluid layout?**

**Answer:**
A layout using **percentage widths** instead of fixed pixel values, allowing it to stretch and shrink with the viewport.

```css
.container { width: 90%; max-width: 1200px; margin: auto; }
.sidebar { width: 25%; }
.content { width: 75%; }
```

---

### **Q227. What is the difference between `px`, `em`, `rem`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`?**

**Answer:**

| Unit | Relative To | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `px` | Absolute (fixed) | `font-size: 16px` |
| `em` | Parent element's font size | `padding: 2em` |
| `rem` | Root (`<html>`) font size | `font-size: 1.5rem` |
| `%` | Parent element | `width: 50%` |
| `vw` | 1% of viewport width | `width: 50vw` |
| `vh` | 1% of viewport height | `height: 100vh` |

```css
html { font-size: 16px; }
h1 { font-size: 2rem; }    /* 32px */
.hero { height: 100vh; }   /* Full viewport height */
```

---

### **Q228. How do flexbox and grid help responsive design?**

**Answer:**

**Flexbox** — One-dimensional (row OR column):
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 16px;
}
.card { flex: 1 1 300px; }  /* Min 300px, grows to fill */
```

**Grid** — Two-dimensional (rows AND columns):
```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 16px;
}
```

> Grid with `auto-fit` and `minmax()` creates responsive layouts **without media queries**.

---

### **Q229. What is a hamburger menu?**

**Answer:**
A mobile navigation pattern using three horizontal lines (☰) that toggles a menu.

```html
<button class="hamburger" onclick="toggleMenu()">☰</button>
<nav id="mobile-menu" class="hidden">
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/about">About</a>
  <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
</nav>

<script>
function toggleMenu() {
  document.getElementById("mobile-menu").classList.toggle("hidden");
}
</script>

<style>
.hidden { display: none; }
.hamburger { display: none; font-size: 24px; }

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hamburger { display: block; }
  .desktop-nav { display: none; }
}
</style>
```

---

### **Q230. What are responsive images?**

**Answer:**

```html
<!-- 1. CSS max-width (simplest) -->
<img src="photo.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="Photo">

<!-- 2. srcset for different resolutions -->
<img srcset="small.jpg 480w, medium.jpg 768w, large.jpg 1200w"
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px, (max-width: 900px) 768px, 1200px"
     src="large.jpg" alt="Photo">

<!-- 3. picture for art direction -->
<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="mobile-crop.jpg">
  <source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="tablet.jpg">
  <img src="desktop.jpg" alt="Photo">
</picture>
```

# 13. Web Components & Shadow DOM

---

### **Q231. What are Web Components?**

**Answer:**
Web Components are **reusable, encapsulated custom HTML elements** built using three technologies:

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Custom Elements** | Define new HTML tags |
| **Shadow DOM** | Encapsulate styles and markup |
| **HTML Templates** | Reusable HTML fragments |

```javascript
class PropertyCard extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      <style>
        .card { border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; }
      </style>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>${this.getAttribute("title")}</h3>
        <p>${this.getAttribute("price")}</p>
      </div>
    `;
  }
}
customElements.define("property-card", PropertyCard);
```

```html
<property-card title="3BHK in Madhapur" price="₹85L"></property-card>
```

---

### **Q232. What is Shadow DOM?**

**Answer:**
Shadow DOM creates an **isolated DOM tree** inside a component. Styles and scripts inside don't leak out, and external styles don't leak in.

```javascript
class MyWidget extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
    shadow.innerHTML = `
      <style>p { color: red; }</style>  <!-- Only affects this component -->
      <p>I'm red only inside shadow DOM!</p>
    `;
  }
}
customElements.define("my-widget", MyWidget);
```

**Modes:**
- `open` — Accessible via `element.shadowRoot`
- `closed` — Not accessible from outside

---

### **Q233. How do you create a custom HTML element?**

**Answer:**

```javascript
class AppHeader extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <header>
        <h1>${this.getAttribute("title") || "My App"}</h1>
        <nav>
          <a href="/">Home</a>
          <a href="/about">About</a>
        </nav>
      </header>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define("app-header", AppHeader);
```

```html
<app-header title="PropertyHub"></app-header>
```

**Lifecycle callbacks:**

| Callback | When |
|----------|------|
| `connectedCallback()` | Element added to DOM |
| `disconnectedCallback()` | Element removed from DOM |
| `attributeChangedCallback()` | Attribute changed |
| `adoptedCallback()` | Moved to new document |

---

### **Q234. What is CSS encapsulation in Shadow DOM?**

**Answer:**
Styles inside Shadow DOM are **isolated** — they don't affect the rest of the page, and global styles don't affect Shadow DOM content.

```javascript
class StyledBox extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      <style>
        /* This 'p' style ONLY applies inside this component */
        p { color: blue; font-weight: bold; }
      </style>
      <p>Blue text inside Shadow DOM</p>
    `;
  }
}
customElements.define("styled-box", StyledBox);
```

```html
<p>Normal text (not affected by component styles)</p>
<styled-box></styled-box>
```

---

### **Q235. What is `<template>` cloning?**

**Answer:**
Template content is cloned to create multiple instances without re-parsing HTML.

```html
<template id="card-template">
  <div class="card">
    <h3 class="title"></h3>
    <p class="description"></p>
  </div>
</template>

<div id="container"></div>

<script>
const template = document.getElementById("card-template");
const data = [
  { title: "Villa", desc: "Luxury 3BHK" },
  { title: "Apartment", desc: "2BHK Flat" }
];

data.forEach(item => {
  const clone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
  clone.querySelector(".title").textContent = item.title;
  clone.querySelector(".description").textContent = item.desc;
  document.getElementById("container").appendChild(clone);
});
</script>
```

---

### **Q236. What are HTML Imports (deprecated)?**

**Answer:**
HTML Imports (`<link rel="import">`) were a way to include HTML documents into other HTML documents. They are now **deprecated** and replaced by **ES Modules** and JavaScript `import`.

```html
<!-- ❌ Deprecated -->
<link rel="import" href="component.html">

<!-- ✅ Modern approach -->
<script type="module" src="component.js"></script>
```

---

### **Q237. How is the `<slot>` element used in Web Components?**

**Answer:**

```javascript
class InfoCard extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      <div class="card">
        <h2><slot name="title">Default Title</slot></h2>
        <p><slot name="content">Default Content</slot></p>
        <slot></slot>  <!-- Default/unnamed slot -->
      </div>
    `;
  }
}
customElements.define("info-card", InfoCard);
```

```html
<info-card>
  <span slot="title">Property Details</span>
  <span slot="content">3BHK in Hyderabad</span>
  <button>View More</button>  <!-- Goes to default slot -->
</info-card>
```

---

### **Q238. What is `customElements.define()`?**

**Answer:**
Registers a new custom element with the browser.

```javascript
// Syntax
customElements.define("element-name", ClassName);

// Rules:
// 1. Name MUST contain a hyphen: my-element ✅, myelement ❌
// 2. Cannot be self-closing
// 3. Extends HTMLElement (or built-in elements)

class MyAlert extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.style.color = "red";
    this.textContent = `⚠️ ${this.getAttribute("message")}`;
  }
}
customElements.define("my-alert", MyAlert);
```

```html
<my-alert message="This is a warning!"></my-alert>
```

---

# 14. HTML Security

---

### **Q239. What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?**

**Answer:**
An attack where malicious scripts are **injected** into trusted websites via user input.

```html
<!-- Attacker enters this in a comment field -->
<script>document.cookie</script>
<img src="x" onerror="alert('hacked!')">
```

**Types:**
- **Stored XSS** — Script saved in database, executed for all users
- **Reflected XSS** — Script in URL, executed when link is clicked
- **DOM-based XSS** — Script manipulates client-side DOM

**Prevention:**
```javascript
// ✅ Use textContent (safe)
element.textContent = userInput;

// ❌ Don't use innerHTML with user input
element.innerHTML = userInput;  // DANGEROUS!

// ✅ Server-side: Escape HTML entities
// &lt;script&gt; instead of <script>
```

---

### **Q240. What is CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)?**

**Answer:**
An attack that tricks authenticated users into performing **unintended actions**.

**Example:** A hidden form on an attacker's site auto-submits a bank transfer using the victim's session.

**Prevention:**
- ✅ Use CSRF tokens in forms
- ✅ SameSite cookie attribute
- ✅ Check `Origin` / `Referer` headers
- ✅ Use POST instead of GET for actions

```html
<form method="POST" action="/transfer">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="random-secure-token">
  <input type="text" name="amount">
  <button type="submit">Transfer</button>
</form>
```

---

### **Q241. What is clickjacking?**

**Answer:**
An attacker loads your website in a transparent `<iframe>` on their page, tricking users into clicking hidden elements.

**Prevention:**

```html
<!-- HTTP Header -->
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

<!-- CSP Header -->
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';

<!-- Meta tag (limited) -->
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="frame-ancestors 'none';">
```

---

### **Q242. What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?**

**Answer:**
A security header that controls which resources the browser is allowed to load.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src *;">
```

| Directive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `default-src` | Default source for all resources |
| `script-src` | Allowed script sources |
| `style-src` | Allowed stylesheet sources |
| `img-src` | Allowed image sources |
| `frame-ancestors` | Who can embed this page |

---

### **Q243. What is the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute?**

**Answer:**

| Attribute | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `noopener` | Prevents new page from accessing `window.opener` |
| `noreferrer` | Doesn't send referrer URL to linked page |

```html
<a href="https://external.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  External Link
</a>
```

> Without `noopener`, the external page can run `window.opener.location = "malicious-site.com"` — redirecting the original page!

---

### **Q244. What are HttpOnly and Secure cookies?**

**Answer:**

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `HttpOnly` | Cookie inaccessible via JavaScript (prevents XSS theft) |
| `Secure` | Cookie only sent over HTTPS |
| `SameSite` | Controls cross-site cookie sending |

```
Set-Cookie: token=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
```

> These are set on the **server** side, not in HTML — but important to understand.

---

### **Q245. What is HTTPS and why is it important?**

**Answer:**
**HTTPS = HTTP + TLS/SSL encryption**

| HTTP | HTTPS |
|------|-------|
| Unencrypted | Encrypted |
| Data can be intercepted | Data is secure |
| No certificate | Requires SSL certificate |
| `http://` | `https://` 🔒 |

**Importance:**
- ✅ Data protection (passwords, payments)
- ✅ SEO ranking factor (Google prefers HTTPS)
- ✅ User trust (padlock icon)
- ✅ Required for modern APIs (geolocation, camera, etc.)

---

# 15. Performance & Best Practices

---

### **Q246. How do you optimize HTML page loading speed?**

**Answer:**

1. **Minimize HTTP requests** — Combine files, use sprites
2. **Use `defer`/`async`** for scripts
3. **Lazy load** images and iframes
4. **Compress** images (WebP format)
5. **Minify** HTML, CSS, JS
6. **Use CDN** for static assets
7. **Enable caching** with proper headers
8. **Preload** critical resources
9. **Reduce DOM size** (fewer nested elements)
10. **Avoid render-blocking** resources

```html
<link rel="preload" href="critical.css" as="style">
<link rel="preload" href="hero.webp" as="image">
<script src="app.js" defer></script>
<img src="photo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Photo">
```

---

### **Q247. What are common bad HTML practices to avoid?**

**Answer:**

| Bad Practice ❌ | Good Practice ✅ |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Using `<table>` for layout | Use CSS Flexbox/Grid |
| Missing `alt` on images | Always add descriptive `alt` |
| Inline CSS everywhere | Use external stylesheets |
| Multiple `<h1>` tags | One `<h1>` per page |
| Not closing tags | Always close tags properly |
| Using `<div>` for everything | Use semantic tags |
| Deep nesting (div > div > div) | Keep DOM flat |
| Missing `<label>` on inputs | Always pair with labels |
| Using deprecated tags (`<font>`, `<center>`) | Use CSS |
| Missing viewport meta tag | Always include for mobile |

---

### **Q248. What is the difference between minification and compression?**

**Answer:**

| Feature | Minification | Compression |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| What | Removes whitespace, comments | Encodes data smaller (gzip, brotli) |
| When | Build time | Server response time |
| Input | `<p>  Hello  </p>` → `<p>Hello</p>` | Binary encoding |
| Tools | HTMLMinifier, Terser | gzip, Brotli |
| Reversible | No | Yes (decompressed by browser) |

---

### **Q249. What is `rel="preload"`, `rel="prefetch"`, and `rel="preconnect"`?**

**Answer:**

| Attribute | Purpose | When |
|-----------|---------|------|
| `preload` | Load critical resource **immediately** | Current page needs |
| `prefetch` | Load resource for **future navigation** | Next page may need |
| `preconnect` | Establish connection to **external origin** | Before asset request |
| `dns-prefetch` | Resolve DNS early | External domains |

```html
<link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>
<link rel="prefetch" href="next-page.html">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://api.example.com">
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://cdn.example.com">
```
