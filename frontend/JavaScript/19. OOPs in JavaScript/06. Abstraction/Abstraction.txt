Abstraction
============
=> Definition: Hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.
=> Achieved using abstract classes or interfaces (though JavaScript does not natively support abstract classes, you can mimic them).

Example on Abstraction
======================
{
  class Vehicle {
    constructor(name) {
      if (this.constructor === Vehicle) {
        throw new Error("Abstract classes can't be instantiated.");
      }
      this.name = name;
    }

    move() {
      throw new Error('Method "move()" must be implemented.');
    }
  }

  class Car extends Vehicle {
    move() {
      console.log(`${this.name} drives on the road.`);
    }
  }

  const car = new Car('Sedan');
  car.move();
}
