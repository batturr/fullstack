JavaScript Classes
==================
=> "Object" is a "physical item", which is a collection of properties (details) and methods (manipulations).
=> "Class" is a "model" of objects, which defines the list of properties and methods of the objects.
=> ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.
=> JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.
=> Use the keyword class to create a class.
=> Always add a method named constructor().
=> The constructor method is called automatically when a new object is created.
=> A JavaScript class is not an object.
=> It is a template for JavaScript objects.

Steps for working with Classes and Objects
===========================================
Create a class
==============
class classname
{

}

Create an object
================
new classname();

Example on Classes and Objects
==============================
class Student {
}
var s = new Student();
console.log(s)

Note: without new keyword will get below error.
Uncaught TypeError: class constructors must be invoked with 'new'

{
  class Greeting{
    sayHello(name) {
      console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
    }
    
    sayGoodbye(name) {
      console.log(`Goodbye, ${name}!`);
  	}
  }
  // Create an instance of the class
  const greet = new Greeting();
  
  // Call the methods
  greet.sayHello('Prince');   // Output: Hello, Alice!
  greet.sayGoodbye('Prince'); // Output: Goodbye, Alice!
}
