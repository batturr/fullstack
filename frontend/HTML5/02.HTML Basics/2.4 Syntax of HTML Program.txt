Every html program should have the following syntax:

<html>
 <head>
    Non Content here
 </head>
 <body>
    Content here
 </body>
</html>

Explanation:
    • The <html> tag represents starting and ending point of the HTML program. The <html> tag contains two child tags, those are <head> and <body>
    • The <head> tag represents non-content information of the web page. The information that doesn't appear in the web page is called as "non-content".
    • The <body> tag represents content information of the web page. The information that appears in the web page is called as "content".
