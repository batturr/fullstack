HTML5.2 (2017)
HTML5.2 introduced new features, made adjustments to the HTML5 specification, and removed features that were no longer recommended. It aimed at further improving the language’s usability and interoperability.

HTML Living Standard
After HTML5.2, the W3C and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) decided to adopt a “living standard” model. This approach means HTML is continuously updated with new features and improvements, rather than being released in versions. The HTML Living Standard is updated regularly to reflect the ongoing evolution of the web.
