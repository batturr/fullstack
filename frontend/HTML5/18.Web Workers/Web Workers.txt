Web Workers
===========
• “Web Workers” concept is used to execute a javascript file in background, without effecting the actual performance of the page. 
• It is mainly used to do some background process, such as uploading the file, processing some records etc. 
• The specified javascript file executes asynchronously; the code present within the javascript file can't access the DOM; but it can use postMessage( ) function to pass value from the javascript to regular script of the web page; then the script present within the web page can receive the value and do some process for it.

Steps for development of Web Workers 
=====================================
Step-1: Create a javascript file (for async execution): 

    filename.js 
    Any js code here 
    postMessage(value); 

Note: We can’t access DOM in the async javascript file. We have to use postMessage() function to pass data from the javascript file to the web page. 

Step-2: Create an object for “Worker” class: 
    var w = new Worker(“filename.js”); 
    The “Worker” class represents an async javascript file. 

Step-3: Receive message (data) from async javascript file: 
    w.onmessage = functionname; 
    function functionname(event) 
    { 
    event.data 
    }
