Novalidate Attribute
=====================
• HTML supports built-in validations such as required, min, max, email, date, number etc.
• Disables the built-in HTML 5 validations, such as required, min, max, email, date, number etc.
• If "novalidate" attribute is applied and the user has entered invalid values in the textboxes, and click on "Submit" button, the form will be automatically submitted to the server, without any validation.

Syntax 1: <form novalidate="novalidate">
Syntax 2: <input type="submit"  formnovalidate="novalidate">
