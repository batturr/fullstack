Pattern Attribute
=================
• Used to apply a regular expression for the textbox for validation purpose.
• Regular expression represents “pattern” of the value.
• Ex: Alphabets only allowed, numbers only allowed etc.

Syntax: <input type="text"  pattern="regular expression here">

Eg: <input type="text" pattern="^[a-zA-Z]*$" title="Only alphabets allowed">

^: Asserts the start of the input string.
[a-zA-Z]: This is a character set that allows any letter from a to z (lowercase) and A to Z (uppercase).
*: This means "zero or more" of the preceding characters (in this case, any letter from the set [a-zA-Z]).
$: Asserts the end of the input string.

Example behavior:
Allowed: "abc", "XYZ", "Hello", ""
Disallowed: "123", "abc123", "hello!", " " (space)
