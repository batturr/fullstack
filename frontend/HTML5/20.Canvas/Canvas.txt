Canvas
==================
• Canvas concept is used to create graphics in the web page programmatically.
• Canvas graphics can be created using JavaScript.
• Canvas is optional & mostly not used in 95% of regular websites.
• Canvas is rare to use

Creating Canvas Container
==========================
<canvas id=”canvas1” style=”border:4px solid black” width=”pixels” height=”pixels”>
</canvas>

Get context of canvas
=====================
Context = It is an object, which is used to write graphics on the canvas.
var ctx = document.getElementById(“id”).getContext(“2d”);

strokeStyle
==============
It specifies color of the stroke (line).
ctx.strokeStyle = “color name”;

lineWidth
==========
It specifies thickness of the stroke (line).
ctx.lineWidth = pixels;

strokeRect
===========
It draws a rectangle, with a line.
ctx.strokeRect(x, y, width, height);

fillStyle
=========
It specifies fill color.
ctx.fillStyle = “color name”;

fillRect
========
It draws a filled rectangle.
ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height);

In the JavaScript strokeRect method, the values represent the position and dimensions of a rectangle. The syntax is:

context.strokeRect(x, y, width, height);

For c.strokeRect(200, 50, 200, 200):

200 (first value) is the x coordinate, which sets the rectangle’s starting point along the horizontal axis.
50 (second value) is the y coordinate, which sets the rectangle’s starting point along the vertical axis.
200 (third value) is the width of the rectangle.
200 (fourth value) is the height of the rectangle.

In summary:
The rectangle starts at (200, 50).
It has a width of 200 units and a height of 200 units.
