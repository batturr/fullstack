Session Storage
================
• “Session Storage” is used to store some data in the browser memory temporarily, until the browser gets closed. 
• Session storage also can store string data only, much like local storage. 
• Session storage data is also visible in the browser's developer tools (Inspect Element option). 
Ex: Facebook stores your email and password after login. 

Setting data into Session Storage
=================================
sessionStorage.property = value;
(or) 
sessionStorage.setItem(“property”, “value”); 

Getting data from Session Storage
===================================
sessionStorage.property 
(or) 
sessionStorage.getItem(“property”);
