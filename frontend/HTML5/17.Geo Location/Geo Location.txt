Geo Location
============
• “Geo Location” concept is used to identify the current location of the client device.
• Geo Location returns latitude, longitude values of the client device location, based on which you can display maps, driving directions, traffic, address etc.

Steps for development of Geo Location:
======================================
• Send request to server to get geo location:
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(successcallback, failurecallback, { timeout: milli 
    seconds } );
• Receive the latitude, longitude values:
    function successcallback(event)
    { 
        event.coords.latitude
        event.coords.longitude
    }
