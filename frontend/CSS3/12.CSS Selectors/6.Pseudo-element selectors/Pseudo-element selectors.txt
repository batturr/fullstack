Pseudo-Element Selectors
========================
Pseudo-element selectors are used for styling a specific part of an element - you can use them to insert new content or change the look of a specific section of the content.

List Pseudo-element selectors
==============================
1.The ::before pseudo-element
2.The ::after pseudo-element
3.The ::first-letter pseudo-element
4.The ::first-line pseudo-element

For example, you can use a pseudo-element to style the first letter or the first line of an element differently. You can also use pseudo-elements to add new content before or after the selected element.

In contrast to pseudo-classes that are preceded by a : character, pseudo-elements are preceded by a :: character.

The :: character is followed by a keyword that allows you to style a specific part of the selected element.

The general syntax looks something like the following:

element::pseudo-element-selector {
    property:value;
}
Make sure to use the :: character instead of the : one when using pseudo-element selectors - this will help distinguish pseudo-classes from pseudo-elements.

Now, let's see some of the most common pseudo-elements you will encounter.

The ::before Pseudo-Element
You can use the ::before pseudo-element to insert content before an element:

p::before {
    property: value;
}
The ::after Pseudo-Element
And you can use the ::after pseudo-element to insert content at the end of an element:

p::after {
    property: value;
}
The ::first-letter Pseudo-Element
You can also use the ::first-letter pseudo-element to select the first letter of a paragraph, which is helpful when you want to style the first letter in a certain way:

p::first-letter {
    property: value;
}
The ::first-line Pseudo-Element
And you can use the ::first-line pseudo-element to select the first line of a paragraph:

p::first-line {
    property: value;
}
