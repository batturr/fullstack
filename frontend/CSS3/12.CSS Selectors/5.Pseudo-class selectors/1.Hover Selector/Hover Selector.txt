Hover Selector
===============
• It applies the style only when the user places the mouse pointer on the element, at run time.
• It automatically removes the style, if the mouse pointer is moved outside the element.
• It is also called as “pseudo class”. Whenever the selector starts with “:”, it is called as “pseudo class”.
• Pseudo = unrealistic

Syntax: tag:hover
