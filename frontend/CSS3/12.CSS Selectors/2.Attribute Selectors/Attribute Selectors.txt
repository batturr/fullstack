Attribute Selector
==================
• It selects all the tags that are having specified attribute.
• "[ ]" are the symbols of attribute selector.
• We can use any attribute of any html tag.

Types of Attribute selectors
    1.The [attribute] selector
    2.The [attribute="value"] selector
    3.The [attribute^="value"] selector
    4.The [attribute$="value"] selector
    5.The [attribute*="value"] selector
    6.The [attribute~="value"] selector


1.The [attribute] selector
==========================
To use the attribute selector, use a pair of square brackets, [], to select the attribute you want.

The general syntax for attribute selectors is the following:

Syntax: element[attribute]

This selector selects an element if the given attribute exists.

In the following example, elements that have the attribute attr present are selected, regardless of the specific value of attr:

Example: 

a[attr] {
    property: value;
}

In the example above, a elements with the attr attribute name are selected, regardless of the value of attr.

2.The [attribute="value"] selector
==================================
You can specify the value of the attribute using the following syntax:

Syntax: element[attribute="value"]
Syntax: tag[attribute=”value”]
Example: img[width=”120px”]

So, if you want to style a elements with an attr attribute that has an exact value of 1, you would do the following:

Example:

a[attr="1"] {
    property: value;
}
This code above matches a elements where the attr attribute name has an exact value of 1.

3.The [attribute^="value"] selector
======================================
You could also specify that the value of the attribute starts with a specific character using the following syntax:

element[attribute^="value"]
For example, if you wanted to select and style any a elements that have an attr attribute with a value that starts with www, you would do the following:

a[attr^="www"] {
    property: value;
}
The code above selects any a elements where the attr attribute name has a value that starts with www.

4.The [attribute$="value"] selector
===================================
You could also specify that the value of the attribute ends with a specific character using the following syntax:

element[attribute$="value"]
For example, if you wanted to select a elements that have an attr attribute name with a value that ends with .com, you would do the following:

a[attr$=".com"] {
    property: value;
}

5.The [attribute*="value"] selector
===================================
You can also specify that the attribute value contains a specific substring - this selector is known as the Attribute Contains Substring Selector and has the following syntax:

element[attribute*="value"]
In this case, the string value needs to be present in the attribute's value followed by any number of other characters - value doesn't need to be a whole word.

For example, if you wanted to select a elements that have an attr attribute with a value that contains the string free, you would do the following:

a[attr*="free"] {
    property:value;
}
The code above selects a elements with an attr attribute name when the string free is present in the attribute's value - even as a substring (a substring is a word inside another word).

As long as the attribute's value contains free, then the HTML element is selected - this could match an attr attribute with a value of free, freeCodeCamp, or freediving, for example.

6.The [attribute~="value"] selector
===================================
You can also specify that the selector matches an attribute value that contains a whole word using the following syntax:

element[attribute~= "value"]
In this case, the string value needs to be a whole word.

For example, if you wanted to select a elements that have an attr attribute name with a value that contains the word free, you would do the following:

a[attr~= "free"] {
    property: value;
}
The code above would match an attr attribute with a value of free that contains different kinds of whitespace.

The code wouldn't select elements with an attr value of freeCodeCamp or freediving like you saw in an earlier example because free needs to be a whole word on its own - not a substring.
