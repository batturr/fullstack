CSS Style Precedence
====================
• The css styles are applied in the following order (lowest priority to highest priority).
• The higher priority style overrides the same property’s value of the lower priority.

1. Browser default style
2. Tag Selector
3. Direct Child Selector
4. Child Selector
5. Class Selector
6. Attribute Selector
7. ID Selector

Note: “!important” is used to override the “style precedence”.
